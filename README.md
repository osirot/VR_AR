Intro VR/AR projects to learn Unity 

I recently attended a Woman Who Code workshop to learn about Virtual Reality/ Augmented Reality. 
Here I have posted a few 3D projects I built during the workshop including a 3d solar system!

I walked out of the workshop feeling excited and inspired to learn more about Unity and 3D VR development. 
I will continue to practice this and post future projects here.
